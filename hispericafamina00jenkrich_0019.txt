AUTHORSHIP xi

18743 ‘it is by an Irishman': and elsewhere he says, ‘the
author, who must have been an Irishman....' He did not
record his reasons for thinking so. But one incontestable
fact seems enough. The scene is laid in a country where
the language of the inhabitants is Irish1. The work is there-
fore presumably written in Ireland, and the author (if we are
to attribute the various texts, or even any one whole text, to
a single hand) was an inmate‚ student or master, of an Irish
school.

Analysis of tlze work: tlte A-text.

As the A-text is the only one which is complete, it
supplies a standard to which the other fragmentary texts
may be referred.

1-48. Glorification of the rhetors or sophiae arcatores
and their school, and of the speaker himself as a match for
any of his contemporaries.

49—86. A would-be scholar, a grazier, who has mistaken
his vocation‚ is recommended to go home to his family, where
confusion reigns in his absence. 87—115. The superiority of
the speaker's Latin is illustrated by similes. 116—132. The
connexion of this passage with what precedes is not clear.
It describes the faults which wr1ters of Latin are liable to
commit2.

133—357. A day3, from sunrise to sunset‚ and its occu-

l See A :ew—274, B 65—69. By misunderstanding these passages Professor
Zimmer was led to construet a hypothesis which cannot be maintained. But all
that he has written deserves careful study3 for his wide knowledge of all things
Celtic is only equalled by the freshness, enthusiaffln, and ingenuity with Which he
applies it.

2 Stowasser (Archiv fiir Lat. Lexz'cograplzie, 111. 168) explains the terms of this
passage minutely by a reference to Charisius 26 5 K.

3 This section is introduced by the rather singular rubric ‘ Incipit lex diei.' It
has occurred to me that there may be here a reminiscenee of the rubric ‘Incipit
lex dei‚’ with which at any rate one collection of extr-acts from the Law of Moses
begins. See H. E. Dirksen's Hz'nterlassene Sclzrzflen, Vol. 11. (Leipzig, 1871),
p. 103 (Ueber die Collatio Legum Mosaicarum et Romanarum).

It should be observed that at line 303 and again at line 358 space is left for a
heading, but no heading has been written in.
