THE VATICAN MANUSCRIPT xxv

pressed by competent judges as to the date3 but Ι think we
shall not be far wrong if we place it at the end of the ninth or
the beginning of the tenth century.

Its precise date is not of importance for our purpose. We
would gladly know more of the original from which it was
copied. That original contained (probably seven times) an
abbreviation sor Nam (see below), which the scribe of A
did not understand. It probably contained the square forms
of the spiritus asper (t) in lines 188, 305, 407, and of the
spiritus lenis (⁴) in line 5451. It made possible the confusion
between n and r (line 161 and perhaps line 243); between r
and s (496 and perhaps 128 and 458); in line 23 the omission
of the fourth letter in plasmazcerz't may be due to the same
cause. In line 520 h'“s should represent lzm'us (see Traube,
Nomina sacra, p. 248): in Cod. Bern. 363 I find it so used:
as Mr Bannister pointed out to me, it can hardly stand for
leis. He also writes: ‘sed (line 395) is s: est is twice ÷ (lines
126 and 523): sunt is once ᾖ (line 552). All these suggest
an Irish exemplar. The early use of a letter over q is seen
in descunt (318), ec¹1peratum (47), ἐ] (562), ac‘isi (460). ζ’] <for
quae) occurs four times (131, 361, 510, 514).'

The abbreviation q· is very common for que (and): ξ in
loquelarem (line 120).

Ver? is certainly for uerrunt in line 421, probably also
in line 459. In 301 populau=populauit. In 454 turrita is
indicated by a horizontal line over the t, which should mean
territa (cf. line 122 quaterna, &c.); and in line 61 ppferum is
not normal for proprz'ferum (pp is given by Traube, Nomina
sacra, p. 262, as ‘insular saec. VIII’ for propter). In line 573
qda stands for qnidam, which in 577 is (ida.

The punctuation (;) at the end of line 134 must be a
survival from the older manuscript.

¹ This use of the spiritus lenis to cancel an aspirate Wattenbach had never
seen3 and Professor Lindsay once only in the Codex D of Plautus (Vat. lat. 3870,

saec. x—xi) at Capt. 144 hbstium. [He has since noticed it in the Bamberg
Macrobius and in the Brussels Paschasius]
