GILDAS xxi

attested by the Breton tradition against the tradition of
Glastonbury and Canterbury.

In c. 3 (ib. p. 28, 20) the Cambridge manuscript Ff. 1. 27
reads pallantz‘bzcs, the Heidelberg annotator ‘palantibus forte
perluentibus.' In e. 33 (ib. p. 45, 5)palczta C (Cotton Vitell.
A. VI), D (Cambridge MS. Dd. 1. 17), but propalata A. We
have therefore some grounds for attributing to Gildas the
Hisperic use of palo (τ- reuelo).

Gildas is in any case so interesting to the student of Celtic
Latin that I am tempted to record two small facts which Ι
have noticed in the course of a somewhat minute examination
of the text of the De excidio. One is that Aldhelm's voca—
bulary runs very close to that of Gildas; so that words in
glossaries which at first sight seem to be from Gildas are often
demonstrably from Aldhelm. Once indeed (c. 47) he shews
acquaintance with a particular passage of Gildas‚ when he
describes a tower in these words: ‘turrem minaci proceritate
in edito porrectam et forti liturae compage constructam':
which must be a reminiscence of Gildas's description of the
buildings which adorned the island of Britain: ‘...turrium...
quarum culmina minaci proceritate porrecta in edito forti
compage pangebantur1.'

The other fact tells in the same direction. The Leyden
glossary is not alone in containing consecutive lemmas from
Gildas. The alphabetical portion of Cleopatra A ΙΙΙ (W. W.
pages 338—473)‚ a tenth century manuscript, has also incor-
porated upwards of fifty words, all accompam'ed by Anglo-
Saxon glosse53 nine, for instance, z'n order under the letter c,
ten under d, four under ι’, four under m, four under 0. Except
the all-pervading Aldhelm, no other insular writer seems to
appear at all. The source of these glosses is not noticed by
Lubke²‚ nor as far as I know by anyone else. It seems clear

1 It is well known that Bede reproduced portions of the first 26 Chapters of
Gildas. See Plummer's edition of the Historia ecclesiastica, pp. 9—41.
