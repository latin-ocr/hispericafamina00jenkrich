THE FOUR TEXTS xiii

Section de oratione (126—156) is three times as long as in
the A-text: and the Section which concludes the series is
half as long again as the corresponding section (de gesta re)
in the A-text‚ and the stories are developed quite indepen-

dently.
T [ιε C -text.

As this text is only represented by 223 words (with ac-
companying glosses), not much can be said about it except
that it was different from the other three, but, to some extent
at least, covered the same ground. It has preserved 69 words
(besides various spellings) not contained in the other texts as

T lle D-text.

Of this text we have a remnant amounting to about
150 lines and parts of lines. It contains the short sections
de mari, de igne, de caelo, de campo, de uento, de taberna.
It reproduces (120—132) the singular passage A 484—496 ver-

is unfortunate that the last line, corrupt in A, is lost. The
D-text has preserved about 60 words which are not found in
the other texts. Five of these occur in one line (D 70).

T lae vocabzclary of tlte Hisperica Famina.

This is too large a subject to be dealt with here: and
Stowasser, Zimmer‚ Roger, and others have said a good
deal about it already. In fact too much in general terms.
The words are said to have been hunted up in glossaries.
But what glossaries existed then? and why have they left
so little trace among the glossaries that exist now? What
most strikes me in working through Gotz's Corpus Glossari-
ormn is the entire absence of the most characteristic Hisperic
words. The Leyden Glossary contains one (tithicam), from
Gildas, and one (las. ignis) from Ars Phocae—perhaps one or
