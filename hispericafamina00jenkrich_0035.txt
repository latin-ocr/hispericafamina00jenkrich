THE VATICAN MANUSCRIPT xxvii

Not content with altering the spelling, the scribe of A
must be suspected of changing the order of the words, some-
times through mere carelessness, sometimes because a fitful
sense that his text was in some way metrical led him to
construet intrusive hexameters1. His performances in this
line have been surpassed by a modern editor who ought to
have known better: and we must not forget that the verse
from Virgil which the scribe of A innocently wrote in the
text after line 192 implies an earlier scholar whose familiarity
with classica] writers might tempt him to better the versifica-
tion where he saw a chance.

This mark resembles a large lower-case π, with an oblique
stroke upwards through its second limb. (See Plate I.) It
seems to have been used in a manuscript now lost to repre-
sent nam whenever it occurred, viz. in lines 24, 40, 79, 82, 199,
235, and 273. In the first four cases the scribe of V contented
himself, fortunately for us, with imitating the symbol he did
not understand, generally leaving some space after it, and
calling attention to it the first time by writing RQ (zle. quaere)
in the margin just below. In the last three cases he ventured
to expand it, and wrote 72072; in each case at the beginning
of a line, where non is not found elsewhere in the Hz'spem·ca
Famina. It seemed strange that Mai had written et where-
ever he found this compendium; and stranger still that others
who have seen the manuscript followed him, especially as et
makes nonsense of two passages out of four. I therefore
wrote to the late Dr Traube, enclosing a photograph and

asking whether he knew the symbol as a compendium for
rccz772.

On August 23, 1900, Dr Traube wrote informing me that

1 Thus line 462 should probably run ‘ Fenosaque roseis : pollent predia scaltis’;
but it is difficult to retrace such operations.
