xxxvi INTRQDUCTION

instead of the Irish p’: while in A 61, where the word should
be proprifierurn or propifermn‚ Mr Bannister notes that the
second syllable is represented by p’, ‘which might be the Irish
per.² But Professor Lindsay says: ‘the suprascript i often
takes the form of a mere curve.'

Ac in line 87 has a curved line (⁸) over the c, and it has
what seems to be a similar mark in line 33, and a mark like
a comma (’) in line 104.

The mark of aspiration (Ρ) occurs over the p of [so]phiam
in line 141: and it was probably copied, for in line 124 etere is
corrected by writing an lz above the t.

As far as it goes, this is the best manuscript of the H z'sperz'ca
Famina, as being a faithful reproduction of something older.
If Professor Zimmer had not said that the Breton glosses
were corrupted (e.g. in lines 9, 72), 1 could have imagined
that the handwriting was that of a Breton.

35). This manuscript is included here because it contains
the two alphabetical poems printed on p. 55 ff. and p. 60 ff. of
the present volume, and also the paragraph, ‘Dicit galienus,’ &o
on p. 32. These pieces form an insignificant part of its con-

still contains about 450 leaves.

There is nothing to shew where it was written3 but it was

teenth century. The handwriting, which is what the con-
tinental authorities call ‘ insular,' shews that it was copied by
an Englishman: some of the contents, which relate to the
Emperor Henry III (1039—1055) give us a date before which
it cannot have been written, while the writing itself prevents
us from placing it much later.

The volume is, roughly speaking, a Corpus of Christian
Latin poetry: Juvencus, Sedulius, Prudentius: then follow
Boethius, Rabanus Maurus; a prose treatise by Hucbaldus on
Music (a separate quire, in a different hand); Aldhelm, Milo,
