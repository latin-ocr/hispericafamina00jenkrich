146 [p]atete‚ with i written above before first e. 148 [fram]ine gl....cell:
corium (written rather like conum) gl. i. oculum. 15¹ This is written very
small, and may not belong here. The whole page is covered with tissue paper.
1t is possible that by carel'ully removing this in doubtful places a few more letters
might be read, e.g. in line 132 gibr. Also I am not sure whether there is a trace

osa line after line 151, as indicated by Zimmer.
