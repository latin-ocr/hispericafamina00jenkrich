xii INTRODUCTION

pations are described. (133-177 the awakening of nature,
178-189 of the rural population, 190—221 of the school:
222—302 midday; a wall< and a meal, provided by possessore5‚
who have to be addressed in Irish‚ about which there is some
difficulty as the scholars may only talk Latin: 303-357 sun-
set; another meal, apparently provided by inhabitants of the
town ; then the scholars turn in, some to sleep, and others to
sit up.)

Here follow a number of short sections on various sub-
jects: 358—380 de caelo: 381—425 de mari: 426—451 de igne:
452—476 de campo (or de terra): 477-496 de uento: 497—512
de plurimis (the point of this is not clear. The D-text omits
it. The material recalls B 25 &o and A 32, 34): 513—530
de taberna (apparently a book-chest): 531—546 de tabula (a
tablet): 547-560 de oratorio: 561-570 de oratione: 571—612
de gesta re.

It may be worth while to point out that the two peculiar
passages, 116-132 and 486—496‚ are very similar in language ;
also that the second passage recurs verbatim (the word ter-
restri or terreno has probably fallen out in the A-text before
spnmaticum) in the D-text; a recurrence of which our existing
fragments shew no other instance.

lee B· text.

The B-text is a curious relic. Lines 1—52 correspond more
or less to lines 10—78 of the A-text: then about 2oo lines (two

leaves) are missing. Lines 53—102 = A 262—304. Another
leaf is lost here. Line 103 = A 362 (de caelo). From this
point to the end the manuscript is complete3 but a large
block of text (ΞΑ 381—560) is lost, the scribe having, as
Bradshaw pointed out, written the end of line 125 (= A 561)
straight on after the beginning of line 124 (= A 380). Con-
sequently there is nothing left of the short sections de mari,
de igne, de campo, de uento, de plurimis, de taberna, de
tabula, de oratorio (except the last half of the last line), or
whatever may have taken their place in this text. The
