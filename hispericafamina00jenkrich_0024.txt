xvi INTRODUCTION

Notas, Vol. XV, col. 419-4211, that he noticed in this glossary
words taken from the Irish hymn Altus prosator, and, it may
be added, they are taken from the original form of the hymn
and not from Rabanus Maurus (see Liber Hymnorum 11,
146). It would be interesting to ascertain whether any words
occur which can be referred to Pseudo-Prosper de uita con-
templatz'ua‚ with which this hymn is associated in several
ninth-century manuscripts. ΜΓ Schlutter also traces some
words to the Lorz'ca (p. 51 in the present volume), and sug-
gests one or two emendations which I do not understand.
Binas quinquies (W. W. 194, 33) may perhaps be referred to
Lorz'ca 66.

This is the only glossary Ι have come across which seems
to have used Hisperic texts. Of glossaries which were utilized
as sources of Hisperic Latin Ι have at present found no trace.
Everything goes to shew that the jargon represents an isolated
growth or tradition, of which whatever literary product there
may have been has 'mostly perished.

I give a brief list here of some common words which do
not occur in the Hz'sperz'ca Famz'na. It must be regarded only
as a specimen.

agere auxilium deus panis
albus barba dignus pes
ambo bellum facere posse
animus bonus, malus ille saepe
annus brachia labor sanguis
ante breuis legere sol
apud caelum liber (book) terra
aqua carere luna uelle
arma cogere magnus, paruus uenire
ars communis mortuus uerbum
arx corpus mox uidere
atque cum (prep.) not in A neque uiuus
audire dare nouus uocare
auis debere omnis uox
