x INTRODUCTION

much as was known to him of the B-text; and Ι have re-
produced his arrangement, occasionally but very rarely
introducing modifications of my ownl.

My ambition has been to provide a text as correct as
Ι could make it and also easy to cite or refer to. Ι have
added an Index verborum, partly to shew what the voca-
bulary is, and partly to facilitate the comparison of different
passages in which a word occurs, and so in some cases to
suggest its meaning. In this index the order is by the
nominative of nouns and the infinitive of verbs, even though
such nominative or infinitive does not occur. This interferes
to some extent with the appearance of strict alphabetical
sequence to the eye; but Ι hope it will not make the index
inconvenient to consult.

Further than this I have not dared to go. Ι do not feel
that like Bradshaw I can construe the whole. And where
the meaning of a word does not come home to me, Ι prefer
to leave others to pursue the investigation without prejudice
or infelicitous suggestion to lead them from the right way.

A good general account of the Hisperz‘ca Famz‘na has been
given by Dr M. Roger2‚ who sums up, sanely if not sympa-
thetically³, most of what hasbeen written about them by Mai,
Rhys, Stowasser‚ Zimmer, and others. In fact little ground has
been gained since Mai, who first printed the A—text from the
Vatican manuscript, attributed them to an Irish source.
Bradshaw (Memm'r, p. 341) wrote to Mr Hessels in March,

¹ For instance in line 42 Bradshaw writes

Melchillentaque : sorbillant fluenta alueariis.

Regarding alueariis as an escape srom the preceding line, I print
Melchillenta ε que sorbillant fluenta.

And I have made two lines of line 40, also of line 52, and of a few others. Ι have
also transposed 14 lines on page 24-

³ ‘L'attention que nous avons accorde'e a un homme comme le grammarien
Virgile‚ a des textes comme les Hisperica Famina, ne vient pas d’un choix
personnel; il nous a fallu repondre en de'tail a certains ouvrages ou leur est
attribue'e une importance qu'ils n’ont jamais eue en 1·ealite.’ Jb. (Preface, p. viii).
