xviii INTRODUCTION

If this is true, which is quite possible, the pattern was not
very closely followed. No knowledge of quantities can be
traced, nor any constancy in the number of syllables. But,
besides this, the double assonance between two adjectives and
two substantives is not generally maintained: it is found, for
instance, only about 25 times in the first 100 lines of the
A-text.

Leaving out of the question the origin of this peculiar
verse, Ι will select some specimens shewing its varieties‚ from
the simplest to the most complex,

1. quos : edocetis fastos?
statutum : adeamus oppidum.

2. mestum : extrico pulmone tonstrum.
roseum : laricomi torriminis alite in aremulo clibanum.

3. rhetorum florigera : flectit habenas caterua.
altemm barbarico auctu loquelarem ε inficit tramitem.

quis gnarus decoream : ducet per triuia cateruam?

titaneus diurnas : rutilat orion metas.

multisormis solifluis : pretenui nubium uapore stemicatur arcus radiis.

7. belbicinas multiformi genimine harenosum ι euoluit effigies ad portum.

It will soon be seen that, although in general each verse is
a sentence, this is by no means always the case. Sometimes
a sentence undoubtedly makes two verses or even three: as
A 53-4‚ B 157-159, διε. Sometimes two verses can be made
out, but some doubt remains: as A 52

Qui florigerum : agmen
reguloso : soluerit discrimine.

A difficult case is B215, where a verse ‘nuditatisz crito
tegmine uerticibus’ seems to be imbedded in another ‘Im-
prouisum: illico prospectant latrunculum.'

This simple form is handled with much ability and taste
by the writer or writers who use it. Such a line as that which
I have quoted above as no. 6 is very remarkable: and we are
left to wonder how such a vocabulary came to be associated
with such artistic feeling. It is not enough to suppose that
behind the Latin expression may stand thoughts conceived in
