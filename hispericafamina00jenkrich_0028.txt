(ed. Mommsen, p. 35, line 9) trans tithicam1 uallem euecti,
whence it found its way into the Historia Brittonum (ed.
Mommsen, p. 177) perhaps indirectly through a life of
St Germanus now lost. The earliest existing manuscript
evidence of the word is in fact the Leiden Glossary (VI. 9),
which gives, from Gildas, thiticum; marinam.

As M. Roger remarks, the occurrence of a single word in
two authors determines nothing as to the relation in which
those authors stand to each other. And it may be added
that Gildas can hardly have invented the phrase tz‘tlzz'ca uallis
or used it here for the first time; seeing that in this context
it would have been as unintelligible to his readers as it after-

wards proved to be to the copyists.
Zimmer (Nennz‘us vindicatus, p. 316) notes also uses of

coruscum (substantive), sablones, ruminare, cespitis, piaculum,
macero, common to Gildas and the H z'sperz‘ca Famz'na.

It is possible that toruz‘sfluctz'bus (A 412) is a reminiscence
of toruis uultibus (Gildas, p. 29, 12 and 62, 13).

And it is possible that Gildas used the word populare
as it is used in the Hisperz'ca Famina. In c. 21 (Mommsen,
p. 36, 19) where the other manuscripts read same...pul-
lulante, one manuscript (A) reads populante. In e. 24 (id.
p. 39, 12) ignis ciuitates agrosque populans, A reads
depopulans. Now A, which thus uses populans in the
sense of pullulans and does not use it in the sense of de-
populans, is the codex Abrincensis (from Mont-St Michel)‚
of which Mommsen (z'b. p. 15) says ‘Ruyensis monachus is qui
’ scripsit uitam Gildae...affert locos duos ex Gildae epistula...
usus libro tali qualis est Abrincensis'; and a glance at the
apparatus criticus in the two passages which are quoted in
the Life is sufficient to establish the truth of his statement.
That is to say, the Hisperic use of populans by Gildas is

1 This form is preserved in the Cambridge manuscript F f. 1. 27 (from Sawley
Abbey), also (ί titicam') in the margin of the other Cambridge manuscript (Dd. 1.
17, from Glastonbury). The passage is missing both in the Cotton manuscript
(from Canterbury) and in the Avranches (Mont-St Michel) manuscript.
