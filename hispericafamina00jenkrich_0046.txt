xxxviii INTRODUCTION

Ends: Cachoesis est egritudo magna et pessima cum
fantasia. Ipsa est auis foenix, Then follows:

F legmon apoplexis reuma liturgia spasmus,
endin ε
g Algima bolimus agripnia tricocinare.

Then versesl on the Te deum (10 lines), beginning:

Omnipotentem semper adorant et benedicunt omne per euum.

followed by:

Incipit bibliotheca magnifica. De sapientia.
*Me sine matre pater genuit pariente puellam,
etc. etc.

extend to 13 pages, and end the quire numbered ·XL1111·.

The famous ‘Carmina Cantabrigiensia’ come next2,

Then follow some hymns, including one, ‘O admirabile
Veneris idolon‚' which Traube3 traces to Verona.

Then more medical prescriptions, which end imperfectly,
some leaves being lost4.

the common reading with respect as representing an old

of this manuscript.
