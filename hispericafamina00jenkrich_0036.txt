xxviii INTRODUCTION

the symbol goes back to the Notae iuris, in the manuscripts
of which it occurs in the form N, with variants N and N·;

and that in the Verona manuscript of Gaius the various hands

write sometimes N, sometimes N, and sometimes N. (This
last form, he says, accounts for the interchange of non (N)

and nam (N) in some old texts.)
In Irish manuscripts, Dr Traube had noted N only in

Diarmaid's Latin commentary on Theodorus of Mopsuestia
in the Ambrosian Library (c. 301 inf.). He suggests that
further search would probably lead to the discovery of other
examples; but considers these sufficient fully to confirm my
view that the symbol in Vat. reg. lat. 81 represents nam.

Perhaps someone who sees more early manuscripts than
I can hope to see will find instances in which the same form
of N is used with the same stroke through the second limb.

[Since this was in type, Professor Lindsay has kindly sent
me some fresh information which I refrain from printing only
because he considers his material is not complete]
