THE SYNTAX xvii

lee syntax of tlte Hisperica Famina.

The structure is usually so simple that there is not much
room for syntactical peculiarity. One usage, however, occurs
constantly, viZ. nt (final) followed by the perfect subjunctive (?)
(once, B 156, by captanero). It is so constant that Ι should
be inclined to attribute olinarent in line 16 to the copyist.

In A 77 (irruere), 204 (cudere), 212 (tergere), 320 (poscere),
353 (rapere), the infinitive is used where nt with the subjunctive
would be more usual.

The preposition de is used partitively in A 210, A 598,
B 64.

The strange use of caeteri in the A—text (e. g. in A 500) for
the first of three alternatives may be noticed here. It does
not occur in the extant parts of the other texts

Instances of nominativus pendens occur in B 175 and 187.

T lte rlcytlnn aff tlte Hisperica Famina.

Bradshaw says: ‘It took some little time to master the
rhythm of the lines occupying the first leaf' [of the Folium
Lnxembnrgense] ‘and to see that each line formed a sentence,
and that a sort of assonance was effected by an adjective and
substantive, one of which might be said to form the middle of
the line, while the other came at the end.’ And when he had
found Migne’s reprint of Mai's edition of the A-text, he went
on: ‘Here was a long piece entirely written in this assonant
rhythm, though printed by Mai as prose...I have here only so
far departed from Mai’s edition as to print the matter in lines,
and to insert a colon, or middle point, after the adjective
which forms the assonance with the substantive at the end
of the line.' Stowasser quotes hexameters from virgil, Ovid,
and sedulius, which have exactly the form of what I may call
the normal Hisperic line: eg.

‘ ampla pectoralem τ suscitat uernia cauernam‚'

and considers it to be developed from such verses as

‘mollia securae peragebant otia gentes.’
