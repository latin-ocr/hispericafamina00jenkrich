NOTES BY MR BANNISTER xxix

The gloss is late. “1 give it up; but I arn not

, satisfied to pass your note.'' HMB z'n litt. October

30, 1908.

MS. parierum nosos.

lustrauerunt. Final -int in this MS. is always written
in full, except l. 290 aderit.

Tinulas: ul re-written by first hand (?) over (?) three
original letters, the foot of the l being extended so
as to join the a.

Insontes: the I is as large as the T of Titaneus, l. 133.

The original scribe probably wrote solidum, sub-
sequently changed into solitum by erasing the
loop of d and crossing the straight stroke.

uirg, ἵζε. Virgilius, of which name the final syllable
appears in the margin, which must once have
been much wider than it is now. The same word
is written in the top margin in a hand very like
that of Petavius on fol. 1.

frondosa: final m erased.

same: a late hand has added contraction mark for
m over e.

a letter (? final m or initial t) erased between coenosi]
and aetrae.

Aquatico: the o seems to be added by a later hand
than the one which inserted the c: the erased q is
quite legible.

precordiS, with i written above i.

trices : s added, followed by a comma (‚) to separate

from next word.
A French hand (qu. 16th cent.) underlined celiam,

and wrote in margin ‘ Plinius est usus’

The apparent erasure is, Ι believe, due to a crease in
the parchment, which made the script irregular:
the crease ends between coe and tum.

Rutilantem: the final e seems to me to be by the
same hand (m. 2) which added que.
