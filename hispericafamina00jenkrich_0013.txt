PREFACE

HIS small work has been so long in hand that I have
almost certainly forgotten some of those who in its
earlier stages helped it on. I think Dr Henry Jackson more
than any one else made me undertake it; and I have owed
much all along to his suggestive encouragement. A chance
question addressed to the Rev. H. M. Bannister after the text
was set up in pages, has given a new value to the edition as
far as the A-text is concerned; for Mr Bannister at once
offered to collate the proofs with the Vatican manuscript;
and this he did at least twice, noting every detail (such as
erasures, ἃς.) which could have any significance‚ and com-
municating to me his own conclusions formed on the spot.
Monsieur Leopold Delisle, besides taking a friendly interest⁹
in my desultory labours, deposited the Paris fragments in the
University Library at Cambridge and enabled me to study
them minutely at my leisure. Ludwig Traube has not lived
to receive my thanks for his abundant sympathy and readi-
ness to give more than 1 asked for and more than I was
competent to use. Of those to whom we must look to carry
on Dr Traube’s work, I am especially grateful to Professor
W. M. Lindsay for several letters containing information
supplementary to his remarkable pamphlet on Contractions.
Mr Hessels has looked with a friendly eye on a by-path
