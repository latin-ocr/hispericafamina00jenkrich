vi PREFACE

running near the line of his own studies, and has more than
once told me of articles and paragraphs which otherwise
Ι should not have seen. The Rev. W. G. Searle searched
charters of Athelstam among which he is more at horne than
I am, for Hisperic words. The Bishop of Salisbury‚ visiting
Cambridge for a few hours‚ found, it seemS, the solution of
one enigma (see Index ΞΝ. dedronte). The Provost of
King’s‚ Dr Rudolf Ehwald, Professor Paul Meyer, and others
‘quorum sorte preteriui nomina,’ have all added pebbles to
my heap; and the smaller the heap the more each pebble
counts.

The infrequent reader may wonder what I have done
myself. I am under no illusion as to that. ‘Cedo illi qui

plus nouerit in ista peritia)
