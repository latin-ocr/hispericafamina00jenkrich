THE ECHTERNACH MANUSCRIPT xxxiii

source) of the Winchester manuscript (MS. 3, eleventh
century) of Bede's Historia Ecclesz'astz'ca3 also in the sub-
scription of the Corpus Christi (Cambridge) MS. 140, written
at Bath by one Aelfric3 it is an Anglo-Saxon version of the
Gospels‚ and no Celtic or Irish influence can be proved: but
the blunder Interz'ml for z‘n aeternum suggests unintelligent
copying, rather than original composition.

The colophon of the Hz‘sperz'ca Famina ends at the sixth
line of the page. The next line begins ‘ Ratio spere pitagore'
(without heading), which with its rude circular diagram (repre-
sented in this edition by a rectangular table) occupies the rest
of the page. The next page contains the extract from Galen
(which I have not traced) and the other miscellaneous matter
which Ι have printed on pages 32 and 33, being unwilling to
omit anything which may afford a clue to the pedigree of the
manuscripts, and so perhaps eventually to the history of the
work.

This miscellaneous matter is written as beautifully as the
rest; but only a facsimile could shew the complete want of
intelligence betrayed by the scribe. These short extracts, &c.‚
were no doubt written unconnectedly on the blank space at
the end of the original manuscript. The copyist writes them
continuously in his best style. Three lines near the bottom
stand as follows:

Apineipioaut mundiusq3 addiluuis13 Ani st . Duo
milia; Duce quarai duo sol unde non—1 accep
Eo quod solus. Ad dffi meu conuerte uolo uxore

These lines could not have been written so by any one who
understood what he was writing. The little poem which
begins here had a great attraction for Bradshaw, who was fond
of writing it out. He did not, of course, know the first six lines;
and consequently the re (line 15) was unintelligible, and I do
not know whether the alphabetical character of the verses
suggested itself to him, A and B being absent and C disguised
as K.

¹ Yet in the Bede z'n aeternum is altered by erasure to interim. What does
this mean?
