xxii INTRODUCTION

also that one common source of the Corpus Glossary and of
the Cleopatra Glossary was either a copy of Gildas containing
Latin and Anglo-Saxon glosses, or a set of glossae collectae
from Gildas (which comes to the same thing): and that in
view of the age of the Corpus Glossary‚ this source may be
assigned to a date not later than the eighth century1. An
index verborum to Gildas is much wanted: and when
Dr Ehwald's text of Aldhelm is out, it would not be lost
labour to make an index verboram to that.

lee Lorz'ca.

This has been printed so often2 that it is included here
merely for convenience. Of the four principal manuscripts:

B is printed in the Liber Hymnorum (ed. Bernard and
Atkinson): also in the facsimile of the Leablcar Breac.

C is printed in the Book osCerne (ed. Dom Kuypers).

H is printed in the Book· of Nunnamz'nster (ed. W. de G.
Birch).

K is printed by Zimmer, Nemetas vindicatus, p. 337.

Its connexion with the Hisperz‘ca Famz'na seems to con-
sist merely in the use of certain words also found in that

work.
It seems to have been known to Aldhelm, if tuta pelta

protecti (de laud. vz'rgz’nz'tatz‘5‚ c. XI.) is a reminiscence of
line 30: also perhaps to the compilet of Harl. 3376 (see

above, pp. xv, xvi).

¹ Cleopatra A 111. and C. C. C. have about 1000 glosses (under the letters
a—p) from a common source: and these include some glosses from Gildas, which
occasionally retain their order. Thus in C. C. C. (ed. Hessels, p. 70) we find inhi-
bentibus (Gildas, c. 1), intransmeabili (id. c. 3), inergiae (?), in edito (id. ib.)‚ in-
clamitans (id. c. 4), inbellem (id. c. 5). lnergiae seems to be an intruder. The
glosses to inhibentibus, in edito, inclamitans, are Latin glosses: but the other three
words with their A.S. glosses occur in Cleopatra A 111. in the same order (W. W.
p. 422, 32—34). The glosses of the other group under the letter ι’ (W. W. p. 427,
17—20) are these: insertum (Gildas c. 1), inolitorum (id. ib.)‚ in cucumerario (id.
c. 42), inmane (id. c. 53), none of which will be found in C. C. C.
