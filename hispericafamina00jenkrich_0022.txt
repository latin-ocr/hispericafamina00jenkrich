xiv INTRODUCTION

two more that I have forgotten. The Index to Gotz tells the
same story. Epinal and Corpus have rather more ; but we
know that by the ninth century the Hz'sperz'ca Famz'na them-
selves were being transcribed in such places as Echternach‚
and other pieces containing some of their peculiar words were
in circulation in that part of the continent.

Herr Georg Gom, whose familiarity with glossaries must
be greater than that of most people, puts forwardl what seems
to be a fallacious argument to shew that the word anellum is
an instance of a word taken from a glossary. He quotes
CGL. V. 442, 2, anellum bellnm cz’nz'le dnm z'n duas partes
diuiditur. This is all very well: but he continues ‘ Die
Quelle dieser Glosse ist eine differentia bei Isidor VII. 438 ed.
Arev.: Inter bellum et anellum hoc interest qnod bellnm inter
ceteras gentes, anellum inter cz'nes dictum, qnod anellantnr populi
in duas partes? But in the passage from Isidore the point
seems to be ‘auellum...quod auellantur': in the gloss ‘duellum...
dum in duas': so that it is at any rate sar from certain that
one is the direct source of the other. On the other hand the
Hisperic writer may very well have got the word from Isi-
dore, and not from a glossary at all. Herr Gotz then praises
Stowasser's illustration of cidones (shields) by the gloss cz‘dones
puerorum amatores, as to which Ι can only say I have no idea
what they mean.

There is one glossary, not utilized by thz, which Ι must
mention here. Mr Hessels very kindly told me of it, having
himself heard from Mr Otto B. Schlutter that ‘it quoted the
Hisperica Femina) It is a late tenth century manuscript
in the British Museum, Harl. 33762, unfortunately imperfect,
ending on fo. 94 in the middle of FU. I had no time, when
Ι saw it, to do more than run my eye over a few pages here
and there. The following words (among others) attracted my
