THE ST VICTOR MANUSCRIPT xxxv

than that os the Epternach manuscript, is probably not later
than the middle of the ninth century. The copyist was
evidently struggling with an original illegible in many places:
but great pains were taken to reproduce that original faith-
fully. The corrections may be by the same hand as the rest,
or they may be due to a reviser: they are, I think, in the same
handwriting as the glosses, Breton and Latin, and seem, where
there is any evidence, to have been made before the glosses
were put in. Two instances are shewn in the plate of a space
being left at first and a word, or part of a word, written in
afterwards.

The punctuation at the ends of lines may be represented
by 3· or ·; while ; is used in -b; =-bus, q; :que (in line 10
(ἶ = que in frequenter).

Several forms of a are shewn in the plate: the form seen
in micas (line 63) is rare, but occurs again in arua (line 17),
spadz's (line 27), frusta (line 28) and uapore (line 29). In
tamaram (line 50) are seen the two common forms, and the
special form almost always used after and combined with r;
how easily it may pass into x can be seen by comparing libra-
mine (line 68) with connexa just below it in the plate. I do
not know within what limits of time or locality this form was
used.

The letters b, d, lc, l are clubbed, but rather short and
heavy looking. The only possible trace of g is in algas
(line 17), where the scribe’s first attempt seems to contain
a t (cf. B 193, rotam for rogum). The capital G in line 52 is
shewn in the plate. Capita] q is generally like a lower-case
letter enlarged (eg. line 77); but in line 72 we have an
ordinary Q. The second form of ν is rather peculiar, e. g. in
feruore (line 46). Sometimess hardly comes below the line;
sometimes it descends as low ass. Capital S is generally
half below the line.

The abbreviation for us final is a half circle open to the
left.

In line 8 propriat seems to be for properat, p being written
