THE ECHTERNACH MANUSCRIPT xxxi

waste leaf from the other end of the same volume I found, to
my surprise and delight, to be another sheet from the same
manuscript of Hz‘sperica Famz’na.' The volume from which
they came (MS. 109) is ‘a IXth or IXth-—Xth century copy
of St Augustine on the Psalter, formerly belonging, as did
the bulk of the Luxemburg manuscripts, to the monastery of
Echternach or Epternach‚ founded by St Wilbrord at the
end of the seventh century? So the fragments had come
from Epternach.

It was reserved for Professor Zimmer to identify leaves
4 and 5, which form part of an album of fragments (Cod.
lat. 11411) in the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris. Leaf 4
is numbered 100, leaf 5 is numbered 99. Presumably they
also came from one of the Epternach manuscripts which
are in the library¹; but the trace is lost. It is impossible
not to hope that more leaves may yet be discovered.

Plate II represents leaf 4 the exact size of the original.

 

The beauty of the writing is remarkable. Bradshaw put
it down as IXth—Xth century: Professor Zimmer calls it
‘first half of the IXth,' and Ι cannot help thinking this is
nearer the mark. The plate shews the semicolon marking
the ends of lines, of which we saw one instance had survived
in the Vatican manuscript. It also shews b3 for -bus and q;
for -que (even in the middle of a word, as freq3nter): and also
the 5-like mark for the -us of -bus‚ which seems to be merely
a form of s. The stalks of b, d, h, l are clubbed: a, d, and n
have two forms (a and a, d and a peculiar b, n and N): a
remarkable g (? Irish) has survived in the word fragorz'cantia‚
