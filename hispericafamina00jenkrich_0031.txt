THE ALPHABETICAL POEMS xxiii

T [ιε Rnbz'scal.

Bradshaw of course knew this poem, and recorded its
existence in a note attached to the Luxemburg fragments
(as Professor Zimmer kindly informed me). But it and the
next poem are dismissed in the Catalogne os tlte Manuscripts
preserved in tlte Lz'brary of tlte Unz'versz‘ty of Cambridge,
vol. 111. p. 204, as ‘two pieces in the Greek language, but
written in the ordinary characters'! And it has not, as far
as I know, been printed before. In my account of the manu-
scripts (see below, p. xxxvii) I have mentioned the pieces
that are copied into the volume before and after it; as they
may possibly throw some light on the road by which it
travelled to Canterbury. It is presumably of Irish origin,
and, though obscure in diction, metrically excellent. Obscure
it undoubtedly is, owing partly to the extraordinary way in
which the words are shaken into their places to suit the
metre. Thus in the third stanza it is not at once obvious
that the sense is: ‘O bifax ales, ab heri nudiusque tertius
animaduerti tam uim nisus mei, quoquo modo quit, quam
nedulam normam tis (= tui) ingenii.' The next stanza re-
sembles a verse in a passage printed by Giles (p. 273) at the
end of the Aenigmata of Aldhelm from ‘Codex A’: Pauper
poeta nescit antra musarum sicuti ego.

The glosses are due to someone who understood the

texts.

T lze Hymn (A—&) ‘Adelplms adelpha.'

In the Cambridge manuscript (Gg. 5. 35) this is copied
. immediately after the Rubisca3 and it probably comes from
the same source. It shews, in the Cambridge copy, no traces
of having passed through Breton hands3 but many of the
glosses are the same as in the St Omer manuscript which
does shew such traces3 and these glosses are generally
correct3 while those which are not the same are sometimes

1 The piece has no title or heading in the manuscript.
