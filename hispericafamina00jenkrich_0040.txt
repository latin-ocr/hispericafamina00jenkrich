xxxii INTRODUCTION

but nowhere else, though rotam for rogum (line 193) must go
back to a similar g: E is σαψ, fi is non, tc is tunc, ffi is men,
and so on. We find both ae and e, the latter even in gquorga
(= aequora), and the former in frementoe, z'unxoerat. In lines 73
and 92 tffi stands for tamen (and not for tantum): in line 83
§=sunt (analogously, by the way, to ser=serunt‚ &c.). Hy-
phens occur in line 51 in-{lruer1t, 81 glomerami-ll-ne.

E is the work of a scribe who wrote a beautiful hand, but
was either very ignorant or very careless, or bothl. The book
he copied from (or a book still further back) was probably in
a dilapidated state. This may help to explain the transposi-
tions of lines 25—38‚ which in the manuscript follow lines 39-
48‚ though the inequality of the two passages (81 words
against 61) leaves a certain uncertainty. If, however, this
is the right explanation, a page of the old manuscript con—
tained an amount of text equivalent to from 10 to 14 lines of
the poem. In that case the loss of a quire of eight leaves
would account for the hiatus in the middle of line 124 (125),
where the scribe unconsciously (Ρ) omitted nearly 200 lines.
Incidentally, this hiatus proves that in that manuscript the
work was already written as prose. In line 49 the scribe
seems to have incorporated two glosses, rotulanti and luson,
relating to fulgescentem] and tramitem in the next line: and
in line 135 he does the same with glas, a gloss on glaucum.
The explicit of the poem is not quite intelligible. But it may
be worth mentioning that in the British Museum manuscript,
Reg. 5. E. XIII, which is of Breton origin, a quotation from
one of the Books of Kings is introduced by the formula IN
BASILIONI · LIBRO, which seems to illustrate the words IN
BASILIONIS Pom NONOMATE here. In the Bodleian MS.
Auct. F. 4. 32, INHONOMATESUMITONANTIS occurs on the
back os the title of the Eutychius ; also a g like that in fragori-
cantia mentioned above: and enonomate ?ERI almi amen at
the end. The words SIT SIC HOC HIC occur in the subscrip-
tion (not written by an Irishman but derived from an Irish
