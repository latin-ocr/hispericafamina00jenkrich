THE RHYTHM xix

native Irish. That seems likely enough. But, apart from that,
there is a directness and freedom in the expression itself which,
as far as I know, cannot be matched among other remnants
of contemporary literature. As with the vocabulary, so with
the style3 there is nothing to compare it with. Aldhelm‚ in
his metrical work de laude uirginum, falls osten into the form
of verse (see above, p. xvii), which has been looked on as a
possible source of the rhythm of the Hisperica Famina: eg.

sacra pudicorum quaerentem lucra uirorum (l. 1453),
uincula comptorum passuram blanda tororum (1. 2127),

and in the prose epistola ad Ealzfrz’dmn there are such
passages as these:

nauigero aequoreas fretantium calle gurgites (Giles, p. 92),
aethralibus opacorum mellita in aenigmatibus problematum (ἰὰ).
caelestis tetrica enodantes bibliothecae problemata (ib. p. 94).

poli cardines astriferis micantium ornentur uibraminibus siderum (ia),

and there is altogether quite a Hisperic atmosphere.

Dr Ehwald, on reading the Hisperica Famina, was at once
struck by this resemblance. But in his longer prose work, de
laudibus uirginitatis, Aldhelm's style is ponderous and dull
and runs into sentences of interminable length. Only in
chapter 4, where he is describing the ways of bees, I find
myself reminded of such passages as A41-, A 146—, etc.

Lios monocus uses many Hisperic words ; but he writes in
laboured hexameters.

The hymn Altus Prosator (L. H. i. 66) in certain parts

comes nearer to the Hisperica Famz'na: and this resemblance
is the more important because of the early date assigned to
that hymn.

Tlce Hisperica Famina and Gildas.

The chief word which has been quoted as tending to
connect the Hisperica Famina with Gildas is the adjective
tz'tlcz'ca (= marina), which is found in the De excidio c. 19
