xxxiv INTRODUCTION

The Glossae collectae (C) follow without an interval. They
are written by the same hand, and were probably copied from
the same source, as the rest. The first two are written thus:
Cadus -i· unda sollu -i· ualle: but from this point the glosses
are written above their lemmata in smaller characters. In
no. 26 the last two letters of uigricatus are represented by a
horse-shoe shaped mark over the t: this mark has been mis-
taken by some editors for an n and read as the final letter of
the gloss. In no. 144 catalmol is written as close together as
the tops of the ll in auelloso would allow.

The last gloss, no. 223, would have been an important one
isit could have been read. But just at this point the light
flickers out. Bradshaw in two copies wrote in (in pencil) the
word scotz'ca; but I do not know wlzen he wrote it (which is
important) nor how sure he felt of the reading. Ι can extract
nothing from a faded photograph ; and Professor Zimmer
records no trace of a word legible in the original manuscript.
If scotica could be read, account would have to be taken of it.
At present I regard it as impossible. The nearest admissible
word would seem to be [au]sonz'ca.

3. lee St Victor Mamzscript (X). Of this interesting
manuscript only one sheet, forming two leaves (one much
mutilated)‚ survives. It is contained in the same album as
the Paris fragments of E (Cod. lat. 1 1411), and the two leaves
are numbered 102 and 101 in that collection. Plate III shews
the verso of fo. 102, which I have selected partly to shew the
number 135 written on a space cleared by seraping the vellum.
I have M. Delisle’s authority for saying that this figure is in
the handwriting of Claude de Grandrue, librarian of the abbey
of Saint-Victor at Paris at the beginning of the sixteenth cen-
tury. He says, ‘I do not despair of finding the manuscript to
which our four [lege two] leaves have served as fly-leaves.’
I am afraid the discovery still remains to be made. But I
venture to speak of the fragment as the St-Victor manuscript,
as we have no evidence to carry it back to an earlier home.
